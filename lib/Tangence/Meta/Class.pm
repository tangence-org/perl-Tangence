=head1 NAME

C<Tangence::Meta::Class> - structure representing one C<Tangence> class

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This data structure object stores information about one L<Tangence> class.
Once constructed and defined, such objects are immutable.

=cut

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 $class = Tangence::Meta::Class->new( name => $name )

Returns a new instance representing the given name.

=cut

sub new
{
   my $class = shift;
   my %args = @_;
   my $self = bless { name => delete $args{name} }, $class;
   return $self;
}

=head2 $class->define( %args )

Provides a definition for the class.

=item methods => HASH

=item events => HASH

=item properties => HASH

Optional HASH references containing metadata about methods, events and
properties, as instances of L<Tangence::Meta::Method>,
L<Tangence::Meta::Event> or L<Tangence::Meta::Property>.

=item superclasses => ARRAY

Optional ARRAY reference containing superclasses as
C<Tangence::Meta::Class> references.
