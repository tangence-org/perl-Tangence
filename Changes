            + Encode strings on the wire (dict keys and class names) as
              Tangence strings
            + Give classes ID numbers to refer to in CONSTRUCT messages,
              rather then full class name every time

0.12    CHANGES:
         * Defined MSG_INIT for server/client version negitiations

         * Implement types as first-class metadata values

        BUGFIXES:
         * Implement respondERROR since it is actually being used

         * Redesign of metadata layer to use real objects rather than
           unblessed hashrefs for structural information
         * Optionally parse (but currently ignore) argument names in methods
           and events
         * Created a parse+dump script to test the parser

           ::Server

0.03    CHANGES:
         * Weaken references between objects and connections to remove
           memory cycles
         * Move all the IO::Async-based code into its own namespace tree of
           Net::Async::Tangence

0.02    CHANGES:
